/**
 * Gmail per-site detection assist.
 *
 * Mirrors the google-docs.ts pattern (standalone module + MutationObserver),
 * but instead of running its own grammar pipeline it hands compose fields off
 * to the main content script (content/index.ts) so there is ONE apply path,
 * ONE highlighter, and ONE badge — no double-processing.
 *
 * Why this exists (from the audit):
 *  - Gmail compose is a contenteditable, so index.ts already *can* handle it,
 *    but the compose window mounts/remounts lazily (SPA). The main script's
 *    one-shot focus check on load misses it. We watch for the compose body /
 *    subject mounting and nudge index.ts to activate them.
 *  - The actual apply-revert problem (Gmail reverting our insert in the same
 *    frame) is fixed separately in editorAdapter.ts via the 'gmail' EditorKind
 *    and its Draft-style deferred re-apply.
 *
 * The nudge is a bubbling, composed `focusin` dispatched on the field: index.ts
 * listens for `focusin` on the document (capture phase) and activates editable
 * targets there, so this reuses its full pipeline without exporting internals.
