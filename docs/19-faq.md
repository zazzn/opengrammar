- Run AI fully locally for free with Ollama
- Modify and distribute the code

### How is OpenGrammar different from Grammarly?

4. Configure settings

See [Browser Extension Setup](04-browser-extension-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

### Do I need to deploy a backend?

directly with your own API key (or your local Ollama server). You have options:

- Basic checking only

**Option 2: Bring your own provider key**

**Option 3: Local LLM (Ollama)**
- Run models on your own machine
- No key, fully offline AI

### Is technical knowledge required?

**Basic setup:** Minimal technical knowledge needed
- Follow step-by-step guides
- Copy-paste commands
- Configure in UI

**Advanced setup:** Some technical knowledge helpful
- Running a local Ollama server
- Configuring API keys

### How long does setup take?

- **Quick setup:** 5-10 minutes
- **With local LLM:** 30 minutes

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Is my data safe?

**Yes!** OpenGrammar is designed with privacy in mind:

**Rule-Based Checking:**
- 100% local in your browser
- No data leaves your computer
- Works offline

**AI Checking:**
- Text sent directly to your chosen provider
- No intermediary server — there is no OpenGrammar backend
- No databases or user accounts
- API keys stored locally in browser

### Do you store my API keys?

**No.** API keys are:
- Stored in your browser's local storage (encrypted by Chrome)
- Never sent to OpenGrammar servers
- Only used to authenticate with AI providers
- Under your complete control

### What data is sent to AI providers?

When using AI features:
- Your text is sent to the provider (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- Provider processes the text
- Returns suggestions
- Text is **not stored** by the provider (check their policies)

### Can I run everything locally?

**Yes!** Complete local setup:
1. Use Harper for on-device grammar checking
2. Use Ollama for local LLM (AI features)
3. Everything stays on your computer
4. 100% offline, 100% private

### Is the code auditable?

**Yes!** Being open-source means:
- Anyone can review the code
- Security researchers can audit
- Community can verify privacy claims
- Transparent development

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Why isn't it working?

**Most common issues:**

1. **Extension not enabled**
   - Check chrome://extensions/
   - Enable OpenGrammar

2. **Site disabled**
   - Check Options → Site-Specific Settings
   - Enable current site

3. **No / invalid API key**
   - Add or fix your API key in Settings
   - Or use on-device checking only

See [Troubleshooting Guide](18-troubleshooting.md) for detailed help.

### Why is it slow?

**Possible causes:**
- AI provider latency (try Groq for speed)
- Long text (check in chunks)
- Slow internet connection
- Local Ollama model too large for your hardware

### Why are there false positives?

**Reasons:**
- Technical terms not in dictionary
- Proper nouns (names, places)
- Industry jargon
- Made-up words

**Solution:** Add words to Custom Dictionary

### How do I report a bug?

1. Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/swadhinbiswas/opengrammar/issues)
2. Search for similar issues

## 📊 Technical Questions

### What technology stack is used?

**Extension:**
- React + TypeScript
- Vite (bundler)
- Manifest V3
- Harper (on-device grammar engine)
- Calls AI providers directly via their OpenAI-compatible APIs

**Desktop app:**
- Rust (Win32 + UI Automation)
- Shares the Harper + LLM logic with the extension

**Infrastructure:**
- GitHub Actions for CI
- GitHub Pages for docs

### Can I use it programmatically?

OpenGrammar ships as a **browser extension** and a **Windows desktop app** — there is no
hosted HTTP API. The grammar/LLM logic is reusable in the codebase: the desktop
`ograms-engine` Rust crate exposes a CLI, and the extension's modules live in
`opengrammar/extension/src/background/`.

### Can I integrate with other tools?

**Yes!** Options include:
- VS Code extension (future)
- The desktop `ograms-engine` CLI
- Reusing the extension's TypeScript modules

### What's the roadmap?

See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md):
- ✅ v2.1: Tone rewriting, statistics
- 🚧 v3.0: Firefox support, autocomplete
- 📋 v4.0: Desktop apps, Developer API
